# AGENTS Instructions

Codex agents working in this repository should follow these guidelines:

- Code should be written in a clear, modular style with descriptive comments.
- Keep each Lua module self-contained and avoid global variables.
- When you modify code, run the check script to verify the repository state:

```bash
bash scripts/check.sh
```

This project does not yet include automated tests, so the check script simply notifies that no tests exist.
